# A dynamic model identification framework developed for daVinci Suigical System

There are parallelograms, springs and counter weights in daVinci surgical system so that we can not use existing tools
to solve the dynamics model identification of it. This software framework was developed to solve these problems.


## Features
### Finished
* Symbolic dynamic modelling based on DH parameters and geometric tree
    * Geometrical modelling
    * Dynamic modelling
    * Base parameter generation using QR decomposition
* Optimal excitation trajectory generation based on fourier-series

* Data processing
    * Derive velocity and acceleration from position measurements
    * Zero-phase low-pass filter for original data
    * Remove the data whose velocity is close to zero to decrease the noise for Coulomb friction
* Identification
    * Ordinary Least Square (OLS)
    * Weighted Least Square (WLS)
    * Semi-definite Programming (SDP)
### Yet to be done

* Excitation of robots, using dvrk ROS library
* Output of the identified paramters
* Output of C++ or Python code of identified dynamic model for control use 

### Another to-do list
* ~~Add friction parameters into dynamic model~~
* Add Cartisian constraints in optimal excitation trajectory generation  (check if it works)
* ~~Add constraints of mass, center of mass and friction in SDP~~
* Save and load parameters for each step to avoid repetitive work every time
* Regularize output print
* ~~Add motor inertia~~
* Add spring parameters into dynamics model 
* Optimize the code to make it faster

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Python modules
    * NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, CvxOpt, Matplotlib, PyOpt

## Application and example

## Reference
When developing this work, we referred a lot from the following places:
* [SymPyBotics](https://github.com/cdsousa/SymPyBotics)
* [FloBaRoID](https://github.com/kjyv/FloBaRoID)

## Some problems
When I was using PyOpt, I found some problems with it. In pySLSQP.py file, these changes should be done.
```
gg = numpy.zeros([la], numpy.float) ==> gg = numpy.zeros(la, numpy.float)

dg = numpy.zeros([la,n+1], numpy.float) ==> dg = numpy.zeros([la[0], n + 1], numpy.float)

w = numpy.zeros([lw], numpy.float) ==> w = numpy.zeros(lw, numpy.float)

jw = numpy.zeros([ljw], numpy.intc) ==> jw = numpy.zeros(ljw, numpy.intc)
```
